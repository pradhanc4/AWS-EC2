![Copy of Add a subheading](https://github.com/aws/aws-lambda-runtime-interface-emulator/assets/44122332/72cfe914-81e5-420a-8788-2b6b6208bbc1)

## Question 1: Which AWS services would you use to build the data analytics platform, and how would they interact?

For real-time data analytics, we need services that can handle large datasets, perform analysis, and scale dynamically. Here’s a breakdown:

**Amazon EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud):** EC2 instances will serve as the compute resources for running the analytics applications. They can scale horizontally based on the workload demand.

**Amazon S3 (Simple Storage Service):** S3 will store the large datasets to be analyzed. It offers scalable object storage with high durability and availability.

**Amazon Kinesis Data Streams:** Kinesis will ingest real-time data streams from various sources. It can handle large volumes of data and make it available for analysis in near real-time.

**Amazon EMR (Elastic MapReduce):** EMR can be used for distributed processing of large datasets using frameworks like Apache Spark, Apache Hadoop, etc. It can scale dynamically based on the workload.

**Amazon Redshift:** Redshift is a fully managed data warehouse service that can handle petabyte-scale data. It’s optimized for analytics workloads and supports complex queries.

**Amazon CloudWatch:** CloudWatch can be used for monitoring the performance and health of the EC2 instances, EMR clusters, and other AWS resources used in the platform.

## Interaction Flow:

**Data Ingestion:**
Real-time data streams are ingested by Kinesis Data Streams.
Batch data is stored in S3.

**Data Processing:**
EC2 instances fetch data from S3 or Kinesis Streams.
EMR clusters process the data using distributed processing frameworks.

**Data Analysis and Visualization:**
Analyzed data can be stored in Redshift for further analysis and visualization.
EC2 instances can host visualization tools or dashboards to present the insights generated.

## Question 2: How would you ensure the security and compliance of sensitive data within the data analytics platform?

Ensuring security and compliance is crucial for handling sensitive data. Here’s how we can achieve it:

**Encryption:**
Use AWS Key Management Service (KMS) for encryption of data at rest (S3, Redshift) and in transit (Kinesis, EC2).

**Access Control:**
Implement IAM (Identity and Access Management) to control access to AWS resources.
Use bucket policies and access control lists (ACLs) to manage access to S3 buckets.
Set up fine-grained access control for Redshift clusters.

**Network Security:**
Utilize VPC (Virtual Private Cloud) to isolate resources and control network traffic.
Use security groups and NACLs (Network Access Control Lists) to control inbound and outbound traffic to EC2 instances and other resources.

**Data Governance:**
Implement data governance policies to ensure data quality, integrity, and compliance with regulations.
Utilize AWS services like AWS Glue for data cataloging and AWS Lake Formation for managing data lakes securely.

**Monitoring and Auditing:**
Enable CloudTrail to log all API calls and track user activity.
Use CloudWatch Logs for centralized logging and monitoring of security events.
Set up alerts for suspicious activities or security breaches.

**Architecting Real-time Data Analytics on AWS:** Leveraging EC2 and Ensuring Security Compliance 

**Encryption:**
